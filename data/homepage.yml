  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
Hi! My name is Jessica Lai. I’m a practicing physiotherapist during the day and a professional dancer in the evenings.</p>
<p>
I graduated from the University of Sydney in 2009 and can treat any musculoskeletal issues but my passion lies in treating dancers so I have sought specialised education in this field.
</p>
<p>
I’m currently teaching Salsa, Cha cha, Brazillian Zouk, Merengue, Bachata, Ladies styling, Spins training, Mambo, wedding dances, private individual & group dance lessons in one of the biggest Latin dance schools in Australia. My dance journey started when I was 7 years old in latin & ballroom and I’ve dabbled in many different dance styles since then.
</p>
<p>I’ve won multiple national titles and have performed, judged dance competitions, taught dance & physio related workshops all over Sydney, interstate and around the world.
